# IBM-Machine-Learning-Final-Assignment

In this project, we practice  classification algorithms that we learned in this course, such as KNN, Decision Tree, SVM and Logistic Regression.
The data is loan_train.csv.

Conclusion
Although Decision tree had shown a relatively good result in trainig ,but it is Logistic Regression that out-performs the other models in test .
Decision tree model suffers from over-fitting
